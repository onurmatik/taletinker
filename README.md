# TaleTinker

Create, share, and discover **AI-generated children’s stories** complete with audio narration and a charming cover image.

TaleTinker lets parents craft personalized tales in seconds—tuning realism, themes, character ideas, language, tone, and length—then publishes each story to a public library so other families can enjoy it too.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone & Configure

git clone https://github.com/onurmatik/taletinker.git
cd taletinker
cp .env.example .env         # fill in secrets
```

**Required environment variables**

| Key                                           | Description                                     |
| --------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY`                              | OpenAI key for text, TTS, image, and moderation |
| `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` / `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` | S3 credentials for media storage                |
| `AWS_S3_BUCKET_NAME`                          | S3 bucket for static & media                    |

### 2. Local Development

Run the server locally using Django's built-in SQLite database (no PostgreSQL setup needed):

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

| Service    | URL |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Django app | [http://localhost:8000/](http://localhost:8000/) |


> 💡 **Costs:** Every story generation hits OpenAI APIs. In local dev the quota is disabled, but you’ll pay standard OpenAI rates. Consider using the `OPENAI_API_TYPE=mock` setting during tests.

### 3. Run Migrations & Create Superuser

```bash
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py createsuperuser

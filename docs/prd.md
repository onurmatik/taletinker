TaleTinker is an interactive story generator that progresses one line at a time.
For each step, it presents the user with two suggested next lines and a third option for free-text input.
The system waits for the user’s selection or input for a defined period. If the user does not respond within that time, it automatically selects the first option and continues.
This process repeats until the story reaches an ending.
The user can navigate back to any previous line and fork the story from that point, creating a different continuation and ending.
